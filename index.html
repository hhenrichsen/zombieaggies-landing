        <h2>Digital Orientation</h2>
        <p>
            Orientation and waiver-signing this year are digital. Please read
            the information in this form carefully in order to be allowed to
            participate in the game as a player in both day and night play.

        <h2>Day Play</h2>
        <p>
            This year our game will have two portions, just like normal. The
            first is Day Play. This will look a little different than normal.
        </p>
        <p>
            A map on the website will update every 30 minutes with new
            locations available where QR codes can be scanned for points.
            Players will be randomly assigned to the Human or Zombie teams,
            and will compete among themselves as well as with non-players.
            Different points will give different resources that are worth
            different point amounts for each team. You will be able to scan
            each QR code every five minutes. We're using Point Control in order
            to make this easy for everyone.

        <h2>Night Missions</h2>
        <p>
            Night play will be a lot closer to what you'd expect: games where
            two teams compete for some objective in order to earn the most
            points. Rules for night play will be released a few hours before
            the missions start. You'll have to sign in each night in order to
            receive a bandanna and participate in the mission.
